# What is it?

This is an XCode plug-in that adds TextMate's command-return behavior to XCode.  press command-return at any time and a newline will be added to the end of the current line and your insertion point will move to the next line.

This is especially handy when you are chaninging some value in the middle of a line of code before going on to the next line

As an added bonus, there's also 


# Installation

1. Open the project and build the plug-in.
2. After a successful build the plug-in should automatically be installed; to install it manually move the product (`XcodeSmartReturn.pbplugin`) to `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins` (create the directory if necessary).
3. Restart Xcode.
4. You will need to set up the key keybindings yourself. Open XCode preferences, choose the "Key Bindings" tab, and look for a new menu item in the Edit Menu labeled "Insert newline at end of line".  Set its key equivalent to command-return.

# Usage

When editing any file, type command-return to add a newline at the end of the current line.

This plugin was inspired by Ciar√°n Walsh's [XCodeBracketMatcher](http://github.com/ciaran/xcode-bracket-matcher/) which adds another excellent TextMate feature to XCode.
