# What is it?

This is an XCode plug-in that adds TextMate's command-return behavior to XCode.  press command-return at any time and a newline will be added to the end of the current line and your insertion point will move to the next line.

This is especially handy when you are chaninging some value in the middle of a line of code before going on to the next line

As an added bonus, there's also a command to insert a semicolon at the end of the current line.


# Installation

1. Open the project and build the plug-in.
2. After a successful build the plug-in should automatically be installed; to install it manually move the product (`XcodeSmartReturn.pbplugin`) to `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins` (create the directory if necessary).
3. Restart Xcode.
4. You may need to adjust XCode's key bindings settigns to get key bindings on the menu items provided. Open XCode preferences, choose the "Key Bindings" tab, and look for any menu items that are mapped to command-return or command-;. O course, you can also change the key bindings in the source code as well.

# Usage

When editing any file, type command-return to add a newline at the end of the current line.
